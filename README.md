This example demonstrates a common error in COBOL programs involving data truncation. The program attempts to move a value with two decimal places into a field that only has two decimal places. If the value has more than two decimal places, the extra digits will be truncated without any warning. This can lead to significant errors in financial or scientific applications. The solution shows how to handle such situations to avoid unexpected truncation.
